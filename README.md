# Hostile Kingdom

Hostile Kingdom is a 3D Videogame that combines RTS and roleplay in a medieval fantasy cartoon world that will transport the player into a sad land where every leaving creature is unfriendly & the sun never shines. 

The game will follow the adventures of an unkwnown knight and his company. Estrategical & parallel battles, lots of secret areas, treasures & customizable options are the basic stuff you will find, followed of a continous dangerous world, relentless skeletons, sly goblins and evil necromancers.
