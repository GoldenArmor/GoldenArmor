# Hostile Kingdom

Hostile Kingdom is a 3D Videogame that combines RTS and roleplay in a medieval fantasy cartoon world that will transport the player into a sad land where every leaving creature is unfriendly & the sun never shines. 

Middle town, a small village in the center of the infinite forest, has a new visitor; an unknown knight who wants to be remembered for eternity. The infamous tavern of the village, The Poisoned Beer, is the meeting point of the best mercenaries, soldiers and weird inhabitants of the Kingdom. Of course, The Poisoned Beer is the place where the adventure begins, where the knight will find a group of drunken warriors & form a company to explore the lands of the Hostile Kingdom, fight the legendary creatures that live in there & be the most recognised people of all times...
